Hey guys
pardon my english:)

This is a simple Todo app developed using react, i just developed This Todo app for learn react and how to use the component based web library's. in this tiny Todo app i added two lists they are actually not two lists, one is class component based list and other is function component based list :p but you can use it as two lists lol!!!

In this app i added basic functionalitys like add edit delete and check and i developed it as a prograssive web app so you can use even in offline and it uses browser local storage as database so dont remember to clear storage 	:joy:	:joy:	:joy:
